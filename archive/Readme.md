The googlecode-tags directory contains complete copies of Concurrent-Trees source code for each of the Concurrent-Trees
releases which were made while Concurrent-Trees was hosted in Subversion on Google Code: versions <=2.4.0, released
prior to September 2015.

Concurrent-Trees versions >2.4.0 (since September 2015), will be released from GitHub, and tags for those versions can
be found directly in the GitHub repository.

This project was previously hosted at: https://code.google.com/p/concurrent-trees/
